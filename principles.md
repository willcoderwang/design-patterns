## [6 principles of design pattern](https://developpaper.com/six-principles-of-design-pattern/)

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
    > A class is only responsible for the corresponding responsibilities in a functional area.
2. Open Closed Principle (OCP)
    > A software entity should be **open to extension and closed to modification**. This is to say, the software entity
      should be **extended without modifying** the original code.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
    > All references to the base class (parent class) must be able to transparently use the objects of its children.
4. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
    > Abstraction should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstraction. In other words, it's about interface.
5. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
    > Use multiple specialized interfaces instead of a single total interface, that is, the client should not rely on
      those interfaces it does not need.
6. Law of Demeter (LOD)
    > A software entity should interact with as few other entities as possible.
